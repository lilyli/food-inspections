This is my final project for PBPL 28820: Machine Learning and Public Policy, an introductory machine learning class I took in the spring of 2017. I’ve included the data I used, my code, and the paper I submitted. All data was downloaded from the Chicago Data Portal, except for the 2010 Census data which came from the City of Chicago website. I have uploaded the data I used for my results, but the most recent data can be downloaded directly from the Chicago Data Portal. My code was written in RStudio 1.0.136.
